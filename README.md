# KATKE

**CURRENTLY IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT / UNVERIFIED**

The goal of KATKE is to redefine how modern coding tools function.

With the goal of wherever possible employing, enhancing and augmenting existing solutions such as Rust, Python, Git, semantically correct project file structures, etc.

KATKE is a permissive open-source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## WIP-REFERENCE: Our Current Vision for KATKE

A code editor not too different from a newspaper in looks and feel. Designed to be intuitive, while not being restrictive. Designed to be an integrated solution from code writing, to project compilation and deployment--while not restricting the capability to use other external tools when using them makes more sense. Being initially focused on supporting Rust based programming and Markdown based documentation--while ensuring intuitiveness that begins to rival visual programming languages like Scratch.

## REFERENCE: Tech Architecture

- `pygame-ce` (version: 2.5.3)
  - Serves as the "frontend-framework"
  - Chosen for pixel-perfect precision and flexibility after finding tools like Electron and Flet too restrictive for our needs
  - Docs: https://pyga.me/docs/
- `python` (version: 3.13.3)
  - Serves as the "core"
  - Chosen over Rust for building KATKE itself due to Python's superior flexibility and rapid development capabilities for complex middleware tools, while Rust's current tooling ecosystem makes it unnecessarily cumbersome for this type of project
  - Docs: https://docs.python.org/3.13/
