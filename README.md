# KATKE

**CURRENTLY IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT / UNVERIFIED**

The goal of KATKE is to redefine how modern coding tools function.

With the goal of wherever possible emplying, enhancing and augmenting existing solutions such as Rust, Python, Git, semantically correct project file structures, etc.

KATKE is a permissive open-source project licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Our Current Vision for KATKE

A code editor not too different from a newspaper in looks and feel. Designed to be intuitive, while not being restictive. Designed to be an integrated solution from code writing, to project compilation and deployment--while not restricting the capability to use other external tools when using them makes more sense. Being initially focused on supporting Rust based programming and Markdown based documentation--while ensuring intuitivness that begins to rival visual programming languages like Scratch.
