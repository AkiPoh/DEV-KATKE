# Planning 2025 MVP of KATKE

## First MVP

One might think we should focus on creating an usable text editor first. I do not agree with that appoach.

We should be making an ASCII art editor first. That should be our initial feature.

**Why?**

Cause its immidiate, low stakes, and also helps us create a solid text editor first with advanced text modification features from day-1

We do not need to immidietely begin to start worrying about file browsing, etc. We can just initially offer a quick "scratchpad" from which people can copy the ASCII art as they wish.

This will help demonstrate the prowess of pygame and Python in creating complex application easily.

## So Actual Plan
